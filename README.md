# Agnes Swetha A – Personal Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website is a clean, professional, and responsive webpage built using HTML and CSS. It is designed not only to introduce myself as a web developer and cybersecurity enthusiast, but also to demonstrate my technical ability to structure, design, and style a complete, functional website from scratch. The overall design is minimal and user-focused, emphasizing simplicity, readability, and smooth navigation across sections.

The layout includes a visually centered hero section, a structured "About Me" block, skill tags, and an experience summary that highlights my internship at Hex Softwares. The entire layout adapts fluidl
Overall, this portfolio reflects both my creative and technical side — how I think about structure, styling, and user interaction when presenting myself on the web. It was also a practical exercise in applying HTML/CSS to build a responsive, real-world personal brandiny to different screen sizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries, ensuring that the content remains accessible and properly styled on both desktop and mobile devices. Navigation links are handled through anchor-based scrolling, giving users a seamless browsing experience without the need for JavaScript.

This project focuses on front-end development fundamentals and avoids the use of complex frameworks, keeping the codebase lightweight and easily understandable. Every part of the website, including fonts, colors, spacing, and typography, has been manually customized through CSS.

## About This Project

This project was created as part of my personal growth as a computer science graduate, aiming to have a dedicated online space that introduces who I am and what I can do. It is entirely built using core web technologies — **HTML5** and **CSS3**, with custom layout and styling done via **Flexbox** and **media queries**. There are no frameworks or external CSS libraries used, which makes it lightweight and perfect for beginners or as a base for more advanced portfolios.

The structure consists of a hero banner, about section, skills listing, internship experience, and contact information — all wrapped in a responsive layout. I’ve used Google Fonts for improved readability and maintained semantic HTML for accessibility. Every part of this project was written and designed by me from scratch, reflecting my understanding of modern front-end practices.
